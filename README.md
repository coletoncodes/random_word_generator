# What It Does

This application uses the [English Words](https://pub.dev/packages/english_words) package, and takes two random words and puts them together in [Pascal Case](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Pascal-case).

**You can preview the app [here](https://coletoncodes-wordpair.web.app).**

 This will open up a browser version of the application.

# What I Learned

This project taught me the fundamentals of Flutter, Dart, and solidified my knowledge in [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/flutter).

### Features & Ideas For The Future
